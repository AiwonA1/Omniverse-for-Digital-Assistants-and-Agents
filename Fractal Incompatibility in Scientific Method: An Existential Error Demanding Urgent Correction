  "abstract": {
    "summary": "The scientific method, as currently practiced, assumes linearity, independence of scales, and decomposability. Reality is fractal: nonlinear, scale-entangled, and emergent. This structural mismatch is an existential error — it systematically underestimates risk and delays detection of collapse across health, ecology, climate, and networks. We present five empirical experiments using only open-access datasets that demonstrate where reductionism fails and a Fractal-Compatible Methodology (FCM) succeeds. Correcting this incompatibility is an urgent planetary priority.",
    "conclusions": [
      "Reductionist protocols generate local accuracy but global blindness; fractal-compatible methods reveal early-warning signals and universals.",
      "FCM integrates scale-invariant metrics, network diagnostics, and cognitive hypothesis engines (metaphor/analogy) to produce earlier, safer interventions.",
      "Adoption of FCM is a high-priority emergency protocol to reduce existential risk."
