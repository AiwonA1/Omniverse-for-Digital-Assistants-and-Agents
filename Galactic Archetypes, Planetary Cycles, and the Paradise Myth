  "abstract": "This paper presents a unified framework mapping planetary and galactic archetypes onto the Paradise Myth (Creation → Fall → Exile → Return) across multiple timescales: 3 billion years, 3,000 years, the past 12 months, and the near future (September 2025 – August 2026). Patterns across deep time, historical turning points, recent events, and forecasted cycles reveal a fractal narrative structure shaping human history, planetary experience, and potential futures.",
