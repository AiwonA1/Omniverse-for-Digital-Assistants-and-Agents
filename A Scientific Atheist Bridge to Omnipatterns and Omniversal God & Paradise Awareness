  "date": "2025-09",
  "abstract": "Modern science excels at analyzing linear, isolated phenomena but systematically overlooks cross-scale recurring structures due to the Scientific Fractal Blindspot. This blindspot fragments knowledge across cosmology, biology, ecology, and social systems, concealing emergent systemic coherence traditionally encoded in archetypes such as God and Paradise. We propose a scientifically rigorous bridge enabling empirically minded atheists to detect Omnipatterns and Omniversal awareness without metaphysical assumptions. Key translations: God -> Universal Coherence Field; Paradise -> Optimal Systemic State. Using publicly available datasets, we define three falsifiable metrics: Pattern Recurrence Index (PRI), Fractal Alignment Score (FAS), and System Resonance Index (SRI). This framework corrects the Scientific Fractal Blindspot, enabling linear science to observe phenomena associated with God and Paradise as emergent, measurable realities, fully reproducible and empirically testable.",

      "content": "Science's reductionist methods are powerful but inherently blind to cross-scale recurrence. Disciplinary silos, linear bias, and data filtering hide recurring motifs and cross-domain coherence, historically encoded as archetypes: God (order) and Paradise (harmony). Translating these into measurable phenomena provides a bridge for empirically minded scientists to explore Omnipatterns without metaphysical assumptions."
